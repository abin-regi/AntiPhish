# AntiPhish Browser Extension 🛡️  
**Protect yourself from phishing attacks with AI-powered detection**

---

## 📌 Overview

**AntiPhish** is a browser extension that detects and blocks phishing websites, malicious links, and scam content in real-time using:

- 🤖 **AI (BERT-tiny NLP model)** for text analysis  
- 🛡️ **Google Safe Browsing API** for URL scanning  
- 🧠 **Heuristic checks** like domain spoofing, Levenshtein distance, and regex pattern matching

Built for **Chrome** and **Firefox**, AntiPhish monitors:

- 📧 Emails (e.g., **Gmail**)  
- 💬 Messages (e.g., **WhatsApp Web**)  
- 🌐 General web browsing

to help you stay safe from scams and phishing attacks.

## 🤖 How It Works

### 🔍 URL Checks
- ✅ Google Safe Browsing blacklist
- 🔁 Domain similarity (e.g., `paypa1.com` is compared to `paypal.com`)
- 🔡 Heuristic rules (Levenshtein distance, URL patterns, typosquatting detection)

### 🧠 Content Scanning
- 🧬 BERT-tiny NLP model classifies messages as phishing/spam
- 🔎 Over 50 phishing-related regex patterns detect scam keywords and structures

### ⚠️ Smart Warnings
- AntiPhish displays a **warning page before a risky page loads**
- User sees:
  - Reason for the block (e.g., "Suspicious domain")
  - A suggestion or alternative (if possible)
  - Options to:
    - 🔙 **Go Back** (recommended)
    - 🚧 **Continue Anyway** (with a second confirmation)
